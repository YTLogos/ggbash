\title{Enter into a ggbash session.}
\usage{
ggbash_(batch = "", clipboard = NULL, show_warn = TRUE,
  as_string = FALSE, show_compiled = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{batch}{A character. If given, \code{ggbash_()} will exit
just after executing the given command.}

\item{clipboard}{Default is NULL
    If batch is non-empty and clipboard is non-NULL,
    ggbash copies a resulted ggplot2 object to clipboard.
just after executing the given command.}

\item{show_warn}{Whether to show a warning message
when ambiguously matched. Default is TRUE.}

\item{as_string}{Return the resulted ggplot2 object as a string
not as a ggplot2 object. Default is FALSE.
Ignored when non-batch mode.}

\item{show_compiled}{Print the built ggplot2 command. Default is TRUE.

\describe{
    \item{Geom name:}{the geom most frequently used (based on my experiences)}
    \item{Column name:}{the column with the smallest column index}
    \item{Aesthetics:}{required (x, y), non-missing (shape, size), default (alpha, stroke) }
}}

\description{
\code{ggbash_} executes a new ggbash session for faster ggplot2 plotting.
}
\details{
ggbash provides concise aliases for ggplot2 functions.
By calling ggbash(), your R session goes into a ggbash session,
which only interprets predefined ggbash commands.
Some basic commands like setwd() or pwd() works in ggbash session,
but most of the usual R grammars are disabled.
Instead, a variety of ggbash commands are enabled
for writing ggplot2 script as faster as possible.

If you give a string as a first argument of `ggbash`,
ggbash will exit just after executing the command. Useful for a one-liner.

\examples{
\dontrun{ ggbash() # enter into an interactive ggbash session

# plot a ggplot2 figure
ggbash_("gg iris + point Petal.Width Petal.Length")

#' # plot a ggplot2 figure and copy the result
ggbash_("gg iris + point Petal.Width Petal.Length", 1)
}
